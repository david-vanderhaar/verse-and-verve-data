I scrape at the
edges of a crowd
jerking and yanking at
the awful spectacle
cutting myself on the
nails, teeth, and cuff links
to push through and
see.

Why are we all here
banging head to soul,
clawing at an image 
that can only drive us 
mad?

In the end
I stole a glimpse
at the corner of humanity.
It was disgusting.
We are pilgrims of
a shit mound,
centuries old with
new shit piled on
every moment.
