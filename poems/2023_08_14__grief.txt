Wait for the darkness to settle
in it's place.
Wait long past the hour 
in which you are certain 
it is hungry.

Go out 
into the nearest wood.
Grope at shadows of brush 
until some pursuing thorn has tasted
your blood.
Grab hold.
Pull up the whole briar patch
and pack it into your pocket.
Let the tiny spears 
chafe as you steal home.
Let the needles pierce and
Get caught beneath your skin.

Trudge up steps
into your room
familiar and a comforting.
Now go to sleep 
with your eyes open
and your pant leg soaked.
