If I could gather ten thousand
suns in the palm of
my hand,

Well at first I thought
surely I would
throw them,
open fisted,
with all my strength,
at you.
I imagined a whole cosmos, 
bursting, crackling,
hurtling toward you
like a hot pie.

Then I thought better.
I could simply hold out my hand,
palm sizzling,
arm shaking with light and space-time.
And you would not be able to behold it
You would cower
You would corner yourself
In a dark hole like the
holes you dug
for us.
