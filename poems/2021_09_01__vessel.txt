A filled glass
near the edge of a table.
Do not drink.

This furious, bubbling 
cocktail of fear
will run you through.

It's fumes slither down
from the brim
then lunge up
by heat

and leave smudges
on the window of your soul.

You will sip and singe
your lips.

It's flaming liquid
will engorge your throat
until the insides touch.

It will gush down, quick
And slosh in your guts.

And when you stop writhing
the acid will pool.

And you, it's latest vessel, 
will be served and forgotten.
