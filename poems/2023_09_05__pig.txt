I sat down to read my bible
and I saw a passage that read:

"So the LORD God said to the serpent: 
Because you have done this, 
You are cursed more than all cattle, 
And more than every beast of the field; 
On your belly you shall go, 
And you shall eat dust 
All the days of your life."

and then I scratched out the word
serpent and I scribbled "pig" 
in its place.
And I pray everyday 
that it takes.
