So the Beloved prevailed 
over the Dust-dweller 
with the sling and the stone: 
he struck the Dust-dweller 
and killed him, 
and there was no sword in Belovedâ€™s hand. 
Then Beloved ran and stood 
over the Dust-dweller, 
and took his sword 
and drew it out of its sheath 
and finished him, 
and cut off his head with it. 
When all the dust-dwellers saw 
that their champion was dead, 
they fled. 

Then the men of exiles 
and outcasts 
rose up and shouted, 
and they pursued the dust-dwellers 
as far as the valley, 
and to the gates 
torn up by their roots.
And the dust-dwellers, dead, lay 
along the way to the gates, 
even to the place they made wine 
and the other torn places.
